					<p>Hello, I'm Steven Sachs. As a child I knew very young I was overly passionate about creative arts. I didn't exactly know what, however I knew it had to do with hands on. Music and Art appealed to the most, but I stopped playing classical piano for my family and friends, the day my mother handed me my first hair straightener in 8th grade. After coloring and styling my own hair, I remember the high I felt when people treated me differently based on my appearance. I knew then, it was the beauty and wellness industry. I would beg my friends, my mom or anyone around me to let me practice different techniques on their hair. When it wouldn't come out correct, I recall being so frustrated, that I wouldn't stop until I figured it out. I improved my physical self and educated my passion. I lost over 60 lbs my junior & senior year of high school and made a lifestyle transformation. By then, I was failing all of my classes and doing "practice hair" for my friends, my classmates, my mother & her friends. When my teachers saw my passion for hair, they stopped lecturing me on my grades and helped me pick a beauty school I would immediately start in after that summer. I was lucky enough to then become hired by the best manager empire beauty has ever had. Through beauty school, I stayed passionate and would educate and sell hair products at a couple locations for empire beauty. One of the owners decided to give me the opportunity of a lifetime when I finally received my cosmetology license. Remodeling what was once the "employee break room" became the first "Sax Hair." I put my heart, soul & energy 100% into making sure that every client I took was thrilled and satisfied with my art. If my 22 year old self could approach the 19 year old me, I would talk his ear off. Trial and Tribulation has made the "business owner" I am today... However; Giving, Kindness, Honesty, Karma & Sacrifice has made me, an Artist.</p>
